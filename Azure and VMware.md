 Let’s explore **VMware** and **Azure**, two powerful platforms in the world of cloud computing:

1. **Azure VMware Solution (AVS)**:
    
    - **What is it?** AVS is a **Microsoft service** that allows you to run your **VMware workloads natively on Azure infrastructure**. It’s a seamless bridge between your existing VMware environment and the Azure cloud.
    - **How does it work?**
        - Seamlessly move your VMware-based workloads from your datacenter to Azure.
        - Keep managing your environments with the same VMware tools you already know (like vSphere, vSAN, and vCenter).
        - Modernize your applications using Azure native services.
    - **Key Features**:
        - **Scale**: Get fast provisioning and elasticity for your VMware workloads on global Azure infrastructure.
        - **Integration**: Use your existing VMware investments alongside Azure services.
        - **Windows and SQL Server Workloads**: Azure is an excellent choice for Microsoft Windows and SQL Server workloads.

2. **VMware Cloud on Azure**:
    
    - **What is it?** VMware Cloud on Azure is built on **VMware Cloud Foundation**, which includes software-defined compute, storage, networking, and management. It’s deployed in Azure along with integrated Azure services.
    - **How does it work?**
        - Leverage your existing VMware skills and tools while benefiting from the global Azure infrastructure.
        - Run VMware vSphere, vSAN, and NSX-T platforms natively and at scale.
        - Enjoy fully managed, single-tenant, bare-metal Azure infrastructure.
    - **Hybrid Environments**: VMware Cloud emphasizes hybrid environments and app development.
