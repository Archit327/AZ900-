[CAF](Cloud Automation Framework)
It serves as a starting point for organizations that are beginning their cloud adoption journey or
for those looking to establish a standardized approach to cloud infrastructure.
Key char:
Security and Compliance
Resource Organization
IAM
Networking and Connectivity
Resource Tagging
Automation and Deployment
Monitoring and Logging
Cost management
In the context of cloud adoption, landing zones can be categorized into different tiers based on
the complexity, scale, and specific requirements of an organization. These tiers are often
defined to provide a structured approach to cloud governance and adoption. While the
terminology may vary across cloud providers, the concept generally includes the following tiers:
1. Foundational Landing Zone:
Description: The foundational landing zone represents the basic and essential setup
for organizations new to the cloud. It focuses on establishing fundamental ==security,
identity, and networking ==controls. The emphasis is on creating a secure and well governed environment.
Characteristics:
Basic security controls and compliance.
Simplified resource organization and naming conventions.
Identity and Access Management (IAM) basics.

2. Enterprise Landing Zone:
Description: This landing zone builds upon the foundational tier by
adding more advanced security, governance, and operational features. It is suitable for
organizations looking to expand their cloud presence and adopt more sophisticated
configurations.
Characteristics:
Enhanced security controls and compliance.
Improved resource organization and tagging.
Advanced IAM practices with role-based access Control.
Basic monitoring and logging.
3. Advanced Landing Zone:
Description: The advanced landing zone is designed for organizations with complex
requirements, extensive workloads, and a mature cloud presence. It includes
advanced features for scalability, resilience, and optimization.
Characteristics:
Robust security controls, compliance, and threat detection.
Sophisticated resource organization and tagging strategies.
Advanced IAM with fine-grained access control.
Advanced monitoring, logging, and performance optimization.
Each tier represents a progression in terms of cloud complexity, and capability.Organizations
can choose the tier that aligns with their current state and future goals. The goal is to provide a
structured approach to cloud adoption, ensuring that organizations have a solid foundation and
the necessary controls as they evolve in their cloud journey. Cloud providers like Microsoft
Azure often provide landing zone architectures and guidelines for organizations to adopt based
on their specific needs.
When do we use them are the following scenarios:
Initial cloud adoption to ensure a secure and well-governed foundation
When Expansion and scaling is done LZ help maintain the consistency and best practices.
For particular compliance requirements LZ provide a framework to meet those standards.
Optimization efforts towards cost and performance LZ offer guidance on best practices.

 If you are going for a foundational level LZ then it is called greenfield
if you already have one and are updating or improving it, it is referred to as Brownfield.
This is used extensively for the CAF(Cloud Automation Framework) which is a lifecycle
framework that enables cloud architects, IT professionals, and business decision makers to
achieve their cloud adoption goals. These are the following methodologies that outlines how the
framework uses approaches to overcoming common blockers.
To put it as such the LZ is a scalable and modular to meet various deployment needs. A
repeatable infrastructure allows you to apply configurations to control to every subscription
consistently.

So, the major areas of focus on include:
Identity
Network
Security
Governance
These are independently configured but finally are aligned in a single environment. It essentially
provides best practice architecture tooling.
It is a process to host recommended foundational services to host your workloads in Azure.
Foundational
A foundational landing zone provides a baseline for organizations to build upon as they gain
more experience with cloud services. It allows for flexibility and adaptability based on specific
business needs and can evolve over time to meet changing requirements.
Cloud providers often offer guidance, best practices, and templates for establishing a
foundational landing zone, making it easier for organizations to get started with their cloud
journey.
A foundational landing zone provides a basic and foundational architecture that provides a
secure and well-governed environment for deploying workloads in the cloud.
In Network there is a basic network established. NSG rules to control routing, defender,

link service we can connect the specific services "inside" the Subnet.
Enterprise
An Enterprise Landing Zone (ELZ) in Azure serves as a foundational framework designed for
large-scale cloud adoption within organizations.
It is suitable for a growing organization that is evolving into their own configuration, hence the
advancements and recommended changes that eventually upgrade a foundational one is said
to be the Enterprise Landing Zone.
It acts as a comprehensive solution for managing complexity, promoting consistency, and
ensuring security and compliance across the organization's cloud environment.
In an enterprise-level landing zone, additional services and configurations are introduced to
address the complexity and scale of a larger organization. Here are some additional
components commonly included in an enterprise-level landing zone:
1. Azure Policy Sets:
Purpose: To organize and manage policies at scale across different departments or
business units.
Components: Policy sets with multiple policies grouped for specific organizational
needs.
2. Azure Blueprints:
Purpose: To define a repeatable set of Azure resources that follow organizational
standards.
Components: Blueprint definitions, Artifacts, Versions
3. Azure Blueprints Artifacts:
Purpose: Specific configurations or settings that can be included in Azure Blueprints.
Components: Artifacts for setting up network configurations, security baselines, etc.
4. Azure Sentinel: For cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM).
Workbooks, Analytics, Incidents.
5. Azure Policy Remediation:
Purpose: To automatically remediate non-compliant resources based on policies.
Components: Policy Remediation Tasks.
6. Azure Landing Zone Resource Manager Templates:
Purpose: Pre-configured ARM templates that align with best practices.
Components: Templates for specific scenarios like networking, identity, and security.
7. Azure Policy and Blueprints Governance:
Purpose: Enforcing and maintaining governance controls across the organization.
Components: Hierarchical naming conventions, Resource Tagging Strategies.
8. Azure Resource Manager Locks: To prevent accidental deletion or modification of critical
resources.
Lock types such as CanNotDelete, ReadOnly.
You can have multiple domains in one tenant and multiple domains in one tenant but each
domain can only have one directory and the division of the users are corelated to the AD and
the domain specifically.
The difference between FLZ and ELZ is that the identity and management is simplified rather
than streamlining it.
