To create monthly reports in CrowdStrike that summarize all incidents and event detections detected weekly, along with managing remediation steps, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Utilize the Falcon Platform
CrowdStrike Falcon offers comprehensive reporting and management features. Here’s how you can leverage them:

#### a. **Custom Reporting**
- **Falcon Dashboard**: The Falcon dashboard provides an overview of incidents and detections. Use the dashboard to view and filter data.
- **Scheduled Reports**: Schedule reports to be generated and emailed on a monthly basis. Customize these reports to include the data you need, such as weekly incidents and detections.

#### b. **Event Search and Filtering**
- **Event Search**: Use the Event Search feature to filter events by date, type, and severity.
- **Saved Searches**: Save searches for weekly incidents and detections, and then run these saved searches at the end of each month.

### 2. Export and Compile Data
- **Data Export**: Export filtered data in CSV or PDF format. You can export weekly data and compile it into a monthly report.
- **APIs**: Use CrowdStrike’s APIs to automate data extraction and report generation.

### 3. Creating Comprehensive Reports
- **Data Compilation**: Compile weekly data into a single document. This can be done manually or using automated scripts.
- **Analysis and Summary**: Analyze the data to identify trends, recurring issues, and areas needing improvement. Summarize the findings in your report.

### 4. Managing Remediation Steps
- **Incident Response Playbooks**: Create and maintain incident response playbooks that outline remediation steps for common incidents and detections.
- **Workflow Automation**: Use Falcon’s workflow automation features to automatically trigger remediation steps for certain types of incidents.
- **Documentation**: Document the remediation steps taken for each incident and include them in your report. This can be useful for tracking and improving response strategies.

### 5. Example Workflow
#### a. **Weekly Routine**
1. **Filter and Export Weekly Data**: Use Falcon’s Event Search to filter incidents and detections from the past week.
2. **Save and Document**: Save the search results and document any immediate remediation steps taken.

#### b. **End of Month Routine**
1. **Compile Weekly Reports**: Gather all weekly reports and compile them into a monthly report.
2. **Analyze and Summarize**: Analyze the compiled data to identify trends and summarize key points.
3. **Include Remediation Steps**: Document the remediation steps for each incident and detection, and include recommendations for preventing future occurrences.

#### c. **Final Report**
- **Format**: Ensure the final report is well-structured with sections for weekly summaries, overall monthly analysis, and remediation steps.
- **Distribution**: Share the report with relevant stakeholders, such as IT security teams and management.
