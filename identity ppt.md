**Slide 8: Expanding On-Premises AD to Azure Without Entra Connect Sync**

**Introduction**

Expanding an on-premises Active Directory (AD) to Azure without using Entra Connect Sync involves setting up a hybrid environment where an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) acts as a Domain Controller (DC) replicating with the on-premises DC. This setup allows for direct AD replication and integration without the need for directory synchronization tools.

### Steps to Expand On-Premises AD to Azure

**1. Set Up Azure Environment**

**1.1. Create an Azure Virtual Network (VNet)**

- **Purpose**: Establish a private network in Azure where your resources, including the new DC, will reside.
- **Steps**:
  - In the Azure portal, navigate to `Create a resource` > `Networking` > `Virtual network`.
  - Configure the address space, subnets, and other necessary settings.
  - Ensure the VNet can communicate with your on-premises network via a VPN or ExpressRoute.

**1.2. Set Up Site-to-Site VPN or ExpressRoute**

- **Purpose**: Establish secure and reliable connectivity between your on-premises network and the Azure VNet.
- **Steps**:
  - Create a VPN gateway in Azure.
  - Configure the on-premises VPN device to establish a site-to-site VPN connection with the Azure VPN gateway.
  - Verify connectivity by pinging resources between the two networks.

**2. Deploy a Virtual Machine in Azure**

**2.1. Create an Azure VM**

- **Purpose**: Host the new DC in the Azure environment.
- **Steps**:
  - In the Azure portal, navigate to `Create a resource` > `Compute` > `Virtual machine`.
  - Choose a Windows Server image that supports AD DS.
  - Configure the VM size, network settings, and other parameters.
  - Ensure the VM is placed in the previously created VNet.

**3. Configure DNS Settings**

**3.1. Set DNS Servers on the Azure VM**

- **Purpose**: Ensure the Azure VM can resolve the on-premises AD domain.
- **Steps**:
  - Set the VM's DNS settings to use the on-premises DNS server.
  - This can be done in the Azure portal under the VM's network interface settings or through the VM's operating system network settings.

**4. Join the Azure VM to the On-Premises Domain**

**4.1. Join the Domain**

- **Purpose**: Integrate the Azure VM into the existing on-premises AD domain.
- **Steps**:
  - Connect to the Azure VM via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
  - Open System Properties, and under the `Computer Name` tab, click `Change`.
  - Select `Domain`, enter the on-premises domain name, and provide domain administrator credentials.
  - Restart the VM to complete the domain join process.

**5. Promote the Azure VM to a Domain Controller**

**5.1. Install AD DS Role**

- **Purpose**: Enable the VM to function as a DC.
- **Steps**:
  - Open Server Manager on the Azure VM.
  - Add the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role.
  - After installation, run the AD DS configuration wizard.

**5.2. Promote to Domain Controller**

- **Purpose**: Complete the configuration to make the VM a DC.
- **Steps**:
  - During the AD DS configuration wizard, select to add a new DC to an existing domain.
  - Ensure proper replication settings are chosen, and verify that the Azure DC can replicate with the on-premises DC.

**6. Verify AD Replication and Functionality**

**6.1. Check Replication Status**

- **Purpose**: Ensure that AD data is replicating correctly between the on-premises DC and the Azure DC.
- **Steps**:
  - Use tools such as `repadmin` and Active Directory Sites and Services to monitor replication status.
  - Address any replication issues promptly.

**6.2. Test Authentication and Access**

- **Purpose**: Validate the functionality of the new Azure DC.
- **Steps**:
  - Test logging in with domain accounts on the Azure VM.
  - Verify that Group Policies, user accounts, and other AD features are functioning correctly.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can expand your on-premises Active Directory to Azure without using Entra Connect Sync. This approach leverages direct AD replication between on-premises and Azure-based DCs, ensuring a seamless hybrid identity solution. This setup provides benefits such as improved availability, disaster recovery options, and extended AD services into the Azure cloud.
