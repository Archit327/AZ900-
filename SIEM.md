Security Information and event management is basically a duo role added to create a more effective security monitoring and management.
SIEM features and capabilities. Here are the six main features and capabilities of the SIEM. The SIEM technology has evolved with changing threat and technology landscape. In the next lecture, we will be talking about security orchestration, automation and response automation, otherwise known as SOAR.

In the meantime, let's take a closer look at these SIEM features.
- Log aggregation --> With log aggregation,the SIEM through its log collection layer is capable of collecting and aggregating log data from multiple monitored systems.

- Event correlation --> is a feature that links events from various sources in a meaningful way to generate a high fidelity alert.
- Alerting -->  is the automated event analysis capability. So through the visualization layer, the same notifies the security analysts about actual and suspected security incidents.

- Dashboard -->which we looked at in one of the previous lectures, is part of the visualization layer where security event data are summarized and presented to the analysts in the form of information and charts.

- Compliance reporting --> Most SIEM tool come with inbuilt and customizable reports that can be generated to fulfill audit and compliance requirement.

- log retention --> This is a long term storage feature enabled by the security information management component of the SIEM. Log retention is most times necessary for legal and regulatory policies.


### Security Alertss

Security alerts are a major aspect of security operations, and incident response. Security analysts are like the police or fire fighters or paramedics in the real world, and these public servants swing into action as soon as a 911 call comes through.
There are four different types of security alerts, namely 
- True positive --> which is an alert that correctly notifies the security analyst that an event of concern that requires a response action is ongoing.

- False positive --> which is an alert that wrongly notifies the security analysts that an event of concern requiring a response action is ongoing.

- True negative -->which is a condition where an alert is not triggered unless an important security event is ongoing.

- False negative --> which is a condition where an alert is not triggered whenever an important security event is ongoing.

When you receive an alert, you want your follow up actions and outcome to be meaningful rather than a needless resource draining activity.
This is what is false positive alert causes. False positives, are a security professionals nightmare. They are very common with signature based tools with the most notorious of those tools being the intrusion detection systems.
A low false positive rate is actually a selling point for most security vendors.
Now, for true negatives, your SIEM will be working as intended if no alert is triggered when an event of interest is not ongoing.
A false negative situation, on the other hand, where the SIEM keeps quiet, while you're being attacked is bad.
When you think of security alert, always remember the true positives and true negatives are the ones that you want. False positives is raising a false alarm, and you know how bad that can be.
