  - Choose a database solution based on your needs (SQL or NoSQL).
  - Implement encryption and regular backups.

### 6. **Security:**

- **Azure Defender for Cloud:**
  - Use Defender for cloud for threat detection and monitoring.
  - Implement security policies and recommendations.

- **Key Vault:**
  - Store and manage sensitive information like API keys and connection strings securely.
  - Integrate with applications for secure key management.

### 7. **Monitoring and Logging:**

- **Azure Monitor:**
  - Set up monitoring for resources and applications.
  - Configure alerts and notifications for critical events.

  - Use Azure Monitor for containers for containerized applications.

### 8. **Compliance and Governance:**

- **Azure Policy:**
  - Enforce organizational standards and compliance requirements.
  - Use Role Based access control

- **Audit Logging:**
  - Enable Azure Activity Log and Azure Policy compliance logs.
  - Regularly review logs for security and compliance purposes.

### 9. **DevOps and CI/CD:**

- **Azure DevOps:**
  - Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
  - Integrate with source control, such as Azure Repos or GitHub.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
  - Use tools like Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates for infrastructure provisioning.
  - Version control IaC for tracking changes.

### 10. **Scalability and Performance:**

- **Azure Load Balancer:**
  - Distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers.
  - Ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

- **Azure CDN:**
  - Use Content Delivery Network for caching and delivering content globally.
  - Improve website performance for users across different regions.

### 11. **Backup and Disaster Recovery:**

- **Azure Backup:**
  - Regularly back up critical data and configurations.
  - Implement a disaster recovery plan with Azure Site Recovery.

### 12. **Comprehensive Testing:**

- **Azure Testing Services:**
  - Utilize testing services for load testing, performance testing, and security testing.
  - Ensure the resilience of the system under different scenarios.

### 13. **Legal and Compliance:**

- **Data Protection and Compliance:**
  - Understand and comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
  - Implement encryption in transit and at rest.

### 14. **Cost Management:**

- **Azure Cost Management and Billing:**
  - Monitor and optimize resource usage to control costs.
  - Implement budget alerts for cost overruns.

### 15. **Third-Party Integrations:**

- **API Management:**
  - Securely manage, publish, and analyze APIs.
  - Implement rate limiting and authentication for APIs.

- **Service Bus/Event Grid:**
  - Use messaging services for decoupling and integrating components.
