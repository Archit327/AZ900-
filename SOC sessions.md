### What is Hacking?

The act of compromising the digital devices and networks through unauthorized access to an account or computer system.
It is like an illegal activity and data theft by cyber criminals.

### What is Hacking in context to cyber security?

It is the misuse of devices like computer , smartphones, tablets and network to cause damage to the systems or corrupt the systems.
It can be gathering information or data of users or documents in malicious manner.


In this modern era Hackers are now growing increasingly , using stealthy attack methods  designed to go completely unnoticed by cybersecurity software and IT teams. They are highly skilled programmers in coding and modifying computer software and hardware systems.

### Types Of Hackers-->
#### 1.Black Hat Hackers

These are considered as a "bad guyz" as they often try to hack the network or systems of the organisation to steal data or info , or exploit them for financial gain.
They go out of their way to discover vulnerabilities or loop holes in their network or systems, there actions can do serious damage to the computer user and the org they work for.

They try to steal valuable and sensitive information of the org  and compromise computer and financial systems .


#### 2.White Hat Hackers

These are considered as "good guyz"  who attempt to prevent the attacks that could be caused by the black hat hackers.
The orgs officially hire them to use their technical skills to break into the systems and test their network security and check the vulnerabilities in systems before the black hat attacker detects them and exploit them.

The techniques are same as of the black hat hackers but they dont do any harm they just find the loop holes and vulnerabilities in the systems and prevent them.

Ethical hacking is carried out by these type of hackers.

#### 3.Grey Hat Hackers

These are moreover a combination of both black and white hackers such that they can do hacking with both good and bad intentions.
they can do ethical hacking for bug bounties and even do the illegal hacking for ransom. 
They are not under any organizations they just use their skills and find the vulnerability in the organization's network or system, and then tell them about the bug or the vulnerability and ask them for bounties for appreciations.


#### 4. Skript kiddies

These are the most dangerous hackers. They are unskilled hackers who just use the tools made by the professional hackers and use it to hack any system for the sake of fame among their people.
they don't know any tactics to hack , they just rely on the tools and software available in the market or internet to hack the system.

#### 5.Hactivists

They are like online versions of ACTIVISTS , it can be a hacker or a grp of hacker who anonymously hacks the server or the system of a org or the govt for social works and political works.

#### Devices prone to get hacked

- Smart Phones
- Laptops
- webcams
- routers
- emails(software)

#### Prevention from Getting Hacked

- Software update regularly
- unique and different passwords for diff accounts
- https encryption
- avoid clicking on ads or strange links
- download form genuine sources and websites
- updated antivirus software
- VPNs
- MFA

### ==Phases of Hacking

There are basically 5 phases of hacking

#### 1. Reconnaissance - 
This is first step for starting the hacking procedure, which starts with ==gathering of information== of the target server or network or its any application.
It can be done two ways 
		1. active - in this the attacker directly gets the information from the site of the org getting attacked , or may be directly getting the data or privacy of the device which is to be hacked. So basically it is a direct reference.
		2. passive - this is like attacker will gather info. from diff sources , it can be like social platforms.
#### 2.Scanning - 
Scanning the whole network or server or the application , identifying the threats or the vulnerabilities , searching for the loopholes through which they can exploit that vulnerability and get access to the network or application.

#### 3.Gaining Access - 
Getting access to the particular network or the application or device , by exploiting that particular vulnerability as a window to attack on that particular device.
The hacker tries to exploit that vulnerability and increase his privilege to the admin level to get all the access of the network or software and install the application that he needs to install to do the hack and theft or to modify the data.

##### 4. Maintaining Access
the main theme of maintaining access is to keep the hacker inside the network of the targeted system . This is until he gathers the data he deems valuable and until his all data gathering is done he has to maintain the access in the system.
The hacker can keep the backdoor accessible by installing a hidden infrastructure like trojan horse, rootkits, and channels.
#### 5.Clearing Track
After the theft is complete and its time to come out of the system, the hacker has to clear all the footprints .The footprints can be the changes made by him in the system, or the software he has installed to gather data or get login access.

This is the most imp part for the hacker to take care of, as he should not be traced.
This phase also comes under maintaining access, as he has to clear his footprints to avoid detection while maintaining access.

#### Vulnerability -
vulnerabilities are the weakness or the loopholes that can be exploited by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to a computer system.
after exploiting(misusing )the vulnerability a cyber attacker can run malicious codes , install malware and steal sensitive data.

#### Exploit 
it is like misusing the that known vulnerability for bad cause.
It can be done by software , tools or malicious code.
It can be a program or instruction designed to find the vulnerability, or the loop holes in the network to take advantage to gain access in the application or the system.

#### Payload
So payload is the thing which enters to the victims network or device and does the harm or steal data or any other sensitive info. It is famous for creating a impact in the victims system.
Payload is the thing which will be the responsible for creating all the mess or loss.
Stealing of sensitive info , or hacking the software, writing malicious codes , injecting codes etc.

exploit - the object or the zariya uss galti (vulnerability ) ka fayeda uthaane ka 
payload -- its the impact caused after that exploit on vulnerability
risk - its the loss or the haani (hindi)

### Log4J vulnerability

It is a vulnerability present in apache web server .
so there is a java based software utility which is used to record the user activities.
in the version 2.0-2.14 there is a vulnerability in log4j utility.

### Vulnerability

### Types of Vulnerabilities-
- **USERS** - the human make such mistake or errors. It can intentional or may be unintentional , which can affect the security of the server or applications or the network.
- **Operating** **Systems** - so the unresolved bugs in the OS , or if the OS is not patched then it can be vulnerability which may be exploited by the hacker.
- **Applications** -

#### Famous known Vulnerability

1. out of bounds write vulnerability-
   This allows an attacker to conduct execution of code or commands
2. authentication bypass vulnerability-
   allows an unauthorized user to enter and gain privileged access without proper credentials
3. code injection vulnerability-
   this is a type of web vulnerability , that occurs when an application sends untrusted  data to an interpreter and here the attacker will inject malicious code or commands , which will exploit the web application, the server or the system.   
4. buffer overflow vulnerability-
   this occurs when the data stored in the buffer is more than capacity of buffer , then buffer overflows causing the data to overflow into adjacent storage.
   which can cause system crash, thereby creating a chance for attacker to enter.

### Features of Cyber Security

#### Confidentiality
it serves as securing the sensitive data from unwanted access or unauthorized user, secure from the internet or any other way that can make that data available out of the org.
basically hiding the data and info from outside the org.


### Integrity
Maintaining the consistency , accuracy and trustworthiness of data through out the lifecycle .
The data must be always uptodate and complete and have not been accidentally modified  by the unauthorized user.

### Availability
It refers to the capacity for authorized users or parties to access the information on a consistent and timely access.
Basically data should be available whenever you need, wherever u need .

### What is Cyber Threat?

It is a harmful act that aims to harm data , steal data or otherwise disrupt digital life.
it is like an event that can negatively harm the org, it can may be shut down the org for a particular period of time.

### Types of cyber Threats
There are basically 3 types of cyber threat
1. Network Threat
2. Host Threat
3. Application Host

### Malware

It is a malicious software that poses a major threat to the computer system as it gets into the device maliciously and cause extensive damage to the system,. It can get inside with many ways.

Ways by which the MALWARE can enter to your system-->
**7 ways malware can get into your device**

- Phishing and malspam emails 
- Fraudulent websites 
- USB flash drives 
- P2P sharing and torrents 
- Compromised software 
- Adware 
- Fake apps 


### Types of Malware

- Adware - is unwanted software designed to throw advertisements up on your screen, most often within a web browser.they simply trick you to click on it and then install the malware in your device.
- Spyware - it secretly observes about the computer activities without the permissions and report to the adversery. It basically enters to the device by phishing or spoofing- by clicking the untrusted links or downloading some file from untrusted sources.
- Virus - virus is a kind of malware which once gets inside the network or the system then starts replicating itself inside the system and infects the whole system. It just ==needs a human contact to start replicating== , it can be clicking on the some link or installing any software or file from untrusted location.
- Worms - it is all over same as that of the VIRUS , there is just a small difference , that is ==it doesn't require any human contact for replication==, it does that automatically.
- Trojan Horse - 
- Ransomware
- Rootkit
- keylogger
- Backdoor
- botnet

#### How to tell the device is infected with Malware ?

- computer slows down
- popup ads on the screen
- system crashing
- mysterious lots of disk space
- increase in internet activity rather than ur task
- changes in browser - new home page, new extensions and plugins downloaded, 
- the antivirus stops working and not able to get access to it and turn it back ON
- lose the access to the entire computer or some particular file
