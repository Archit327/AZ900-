### The five dimension of planning

1. What are you trying to do
2. where are you going to do
3. how much of it do we need
4. how are you going to connect it
5. how are you going to manage it



Decisions Before Planning -->
- do you have any footprint from before?
- is AVS supported in that region?
- if not supported than which is the closest AVS supported region to your existing data center or the user?
- does the customer need AVS private clouds in multiple regions


### Planning for the Size considerations

- determine the initial size and number of clusters and number of host per region required?

## Limits -->
we can have
- ==1 PRIVAT CLOUD PER SUBSCRIPTION==
- ==12 CLUSTERS PER PRIVATE CLOUD==
- ==16 HOSTS PER CLUSTER
- ==96 HOSTS PER PRIVATE CLOUD==
