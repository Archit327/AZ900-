## What is the SIEM Solution?

SIEM, or Security Information and Event Management, is a solution that gathers logs from all sources of data within your company, examines patterns and occurrences, and notifies the system of any questionable activity.

**By outlining the tool’s two main purposes**

- A safe, central location for gathering log data. It gathers log entry information related to preventing unwanted access from all devices and systems connected to the network.
- Analysis and correlation of such log entries. SIEM uses ML and AI to identify patterns of harmful activity and trigger alarms.

A sophisticated SIEM technology minimizes false positives and produces alerts in accordance with assessed priorities. By consolidating all relevant security information onto a single platform, it improves visibility. Improved vision results in a more profound comprehension.

It’s crucial to remember that SIEM cannot stop cyberattacks. It’s a tool for detection. Early cyberattack detection allows security professionals to take preventative action. SIEM reduces possible loss or harm and stops it from getting worse. The technology must be configured properly in order to function to its fullest potential, and security specialists must comprehend and act upon the alarms.

Security Information and event management is basically a duo role added to create a more effective security monitoring and management.
## SIEM features and capabilities
Here are the six main features and capabilities of the SIEM. The SIEM technology has evolved with changing threat and technology landscape. 

let's take a closer look at these SIEM features.
- Log aggregation --> With log aggregation,the SIEM through its log collection layer is capable of collecting and aggregating log data from multiple monitored systems.

- Event correlation --> is a feature that links events from various sources in a meaningful way to generate a high fidelity alert.
- Alerting -->  is the automated event analysis capability. So through the visualization layer, the same notifies the security analysts about actual and suspected security incidents.

- Dashboard -->which we looked at in one of the previous lectures, is part of the visualization layer where security event data are summarized and presented to the analysts in the form of information and charts.

- Compliance reporting --> Most SIEM tool come with inbuilt and customizable reports that can be generated to fulfill audit and compliance requirement.

- log retention --> This is a long term storage feature enabled by the security information management component of the SIEM. Log retention is most times necessary for legal and regulatory policies.


### Security Alertss

Security alerts are a major aspect of security operations, and incident response. Security analysts are like the police or fire fighters or paramedics in the real world, and these public servants swing into action as soon as a 911 call comes through.
There are four different types of security alerts, namely 
- True positive --> which is an alert that correctly notifies the security analyst that an event of concern that requires a response action is ongoing.

- False positive --> which is an alert that wrongly notifies the security analysts that an event of concern requiring a response action is ongoing.

- True negative -->which is a condition where an alert is not triggered unless an important security event is ongoing.

- False negative --> which is a condition where an alert is not triggered whenever an important security event is ongoing.

When you receive an alert, you want your follow up actions and outcome to be meaningful rather than a needless resource draining activity.
This is what is false positive alert causes. False positives, are a security professionals nightmare. They are very common with signature based tools with the most notorious of those tools being the intrusion detection systems.
A low false positive rate is actually a selling point for most security vendors.
Now, for true negatives, your SIEM will be working as intended if no alert is triggered when an event of interest is not ongoing.
A false negative situation, on the other hand, where the SIEM keeps quiet, while you're being attacked is bad.
When you think of security alert, always remember the true positives and true negatives are the ones that you want. False positives is raising a false alarm, and you know how bad that can be. 


## SIEM in basic terms

SIEM is a platform that ingests all of your security data from various corners of your network. It stores it for compliance needs, and to assist threat hunting and investigations.
It combines data from various sources and correlates it to
spot suspicious activity. 
The heart of a SIEM solution is a big data and analytics engine
which can be used to apply intelligence to security information and help sift through it. Traditional SIEM provides a single source for your security data and provides actionable intelligence, but doesn't provide any kind of automated remediation.
