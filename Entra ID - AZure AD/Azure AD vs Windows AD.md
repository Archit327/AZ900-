While Active Directory and Azure Active Directory share some common identity management capabilities and can synchronize with each other, some of their core features differ:

### User Management

Active Directory is designed for managing internal user accounts and organizing resources using domains, forests, sites and organizational units.

Azure AD is optimized for managing external partner identities and supporting B2B collaboration scenarios in the cloud.

### Authentication and Protocols

Active Directory relies on Kerberos and NTLM for internal network authentication of devices and services.

Azure AD uses modern token-based authentication and federated SSO to enable seamless access across thousands of cloud applications.

### Integration with Resources

Active Directory deeply integrates with on-premises resources like file servers, SharePoint sites, printers, databases, and custom LoB apps.

Azure AD is designed to connect with cloud apps like Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Dropbox, and more. But it can federerate identity to on-prem apps.

### Security
Active Directory offers basic password policies, permission controls and can be extended using Group Policies.

Azure AD provides more advanced security capabilities like conditional access policies, identity monitoring, outlier detection using machine learning, and adaptive multi-factor authentication.

### Administration and Cost

Active Directory requires significant in-house resources to install, configure, and manage controllers. Azure AD uses a usage-based pricing model starting at $1 per user/month for basic needs.

The right identity management system depends largely on your specific use case and hybrid environment.


### Points to Remember When Comparing Active Directory (AD) and Azure AD

Based on Microsoft’s extensive experience helping customers navigate identity decisions, here are some high-level recommendations:

- Audit your identity environment – Understand dependencies, feature you require, future cloud plans.
- Assess needs from a user perspective – Simplify while enhancing security.
- Involve IT teams early – Gather input on integration, training, support requirements.
- Choose Microsoft office apps that support Azure AD – To maximize SSO benefits.
- Test synchronization, SSO, and roll out gradually.
- Manage budgets – Factors and resources responsible for cost  like networking, servers, tools.
- GEt a proper team for supporting the new environment and processes.
