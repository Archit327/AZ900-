Sure, you can achieve this migration from Azure File Share to Microsoft Teams while maintaining the folder hierarchy using Microsoft's SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT). Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Prepare Microsoft Teams and SharePoint:**
    
    - Make sure you have Microsoft Teams set up properly.
    - Each Microsoft Team has an associated SharePoint site where files are stored. Ensure this is set up and accessible.
2. **Install and Set Up SharePoint Migration Tool:**
    
    - Download and install the SharePoint Migration Tool from the official Microsoft website.
    - Launch the tool and sign in with your Microsoft 365 account credentials.
3. **Create a Migration Task:**
    
    - Click on "New Migration" to start a new migration task.
    - Select "File Share" as your source type.
    - Enter the path to your Azure File Share.
    - Choose the destination as "SharePoint Online".
4. **Map Source and Destination:**
    
    - Map the source folders to their corresponding locations in Microsoft Teams.
    - Ensure that you maintain the same folder structure by mapping each folder appropriately.
5. **Configure Migration Settings:**
    
    - Configure any additional migration settings such as file types to exclude, performance settings, and scheduling options according to your needs.
6. **Start the Migration:**
    
    - Once everything is set up, start the migration process.
    - Monitor the progress of the migration within the SharePoint Migration Tool interface.
7. **Verify the Migration:**
    
    - After the migration is complete, verify that all files and folders have been transferred correctly.
    - Check the Microsoft Teams channels and corresponding SharePoint document libraries to ensure the hierarchy is maintained.

By following these steps and using the SharePoint Migration Tool, you can migrate your data from Azure File Share to Microsoft Teams while preserving the folder hierarchy. Remember to plan and test your migration thoroughly before executing it in a production environment.

To get the link or path of a SharePoint site or a channel in Microsoft Teams, you can follow these steps:

For SharePoint Site:

1. Navigate to the SharePoint site associated with your Microsoft Teams.
2. Click on the document library where you want to migrate the files.
3. Once inside the document library, the URL in your browser's address bar is the link to this SharePoint site. You can copy this URL and use it as the destination for your migration.

For Microsoft Teams Channel:

1. Open Microsoft Teams.
2. Navigate to the team and channel where you want to migrate the files.
3. Click on the "Files" tab within the channel.
4. You will be directed to the corresponding SharePoint document library associated with that channel.
5. Again, the URL in your browser's address bar is the link to this SharePoint document library. Copy this URL and use it as the destination for your migration.

Make sure that you have appropriate permissions to access these SharePoint sites and document libraries. If you're unable to access them, you might need to contact your Microsoft Teams or SharePoint administrator for assistance.

and i also want to inherit all the permissions of the users from azure file share to microsoft teams such that the users which had the access to particular file share and particular should only get access and permission to the same folder and other users should not get access

To inherit permissions from Azure File Share to Microsoft Teams and ensure that users retain their access rights to specific folders, you can follow these steps:

1. **Analyze Existing Permissions:**
    
    - Before migration, analyze the permissions structure of your Azure File Share to understand who has access to which folders and files.
2. **Map Users and Groups:**
    
    - In Microsoft Teams/SharePoint, create Teams and Channels that mirror your existing folder structure in Azure File Share.
    - For each folder in your Azure File Share, identify the corresponding Microsoft Teams Channel/SharePoint document library.
    - Create Teams/Channels and set permissions accordingly to match the permissions of each folder in Azure File Share.
3. **Migrate Data:**
    
    - Use the SharePoint Migration Tool or another migration tool to migrate the data from Azure File Share to Microsoft Teams/SharePoint while preserving the folder hierarchy.
4. **Manage Permissions:**
    
    - After migration, review and adjust permissions as needed.
    - In SharePoint, you can manage permissions at the document library level. Ensure that permissions are set to inherit from the parent for folders and documents.
    - Add users and groups to the appropriate Teams/Channels or SharePoint document libraries, matching the permissions they had on the Azure File Share.
5. **Verify Permissions:**
    
    - Test access to ensure that users only have access to the folders and files they had permissions for in the Azure File Share.
    - Make any necessary adjustments to permissions if users encounter access issues.
6. **Communicate Changes:**
    
    - Notify users about the migration and any changes to their access permissions.
    - Provide guidance on how they can access their files in the new Microsoft Teams/SharePoint environment.

By following these steps, you can migrate data from Azure File Share to Microsoft Teams/SharePoint while ensuring that users retain their access permissions to specific folders and files. Proper planning and communication are essential to ensure a smooth transition for users.
