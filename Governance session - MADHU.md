## Day 1
### What is GRC
GRC stands for Governance - Risk - Compliance.
#### Governance

**Governance in cloud basically means governing that the RIGHT PEOPLE ARE DEPLOYING RIGHT RESOURCES WITH RIGHT CONFIGURATIONS. **

It Â is a set of policies, rules, or frameworks that a company uses to achieve its business goals. It defines the responsibilities of administrator, such as the board of directors and senior management.
A good org would have governance as in
- **Ethics** - like proper punch in punch out
- **Accountability** - the higher authority should be answerable to any mishappening
- **Information sharing** - there should be transparency in some aspect
- **Policies** - set of rules which each and every employee should take care of

#### Risk
There can be any type of risk
- Financial risk
- physical risk
- Legal Risks
- Data breach risk
A good org will have proper risk management so that they can find security loopholes.
They will have time to time risk assessment procedures to have uptodate and have full command on the Environment.

#### Compliance
Compliance is the act of following rules, laws, and regulations. It applies to legal and regulatory requirements set by industrial bodies and also for internal corporate policies.
In GRC, compliance involves implementing procedures to ensure that business activities comply with the respective regulations. For example, healthcare organizations must comply with laws like HIPAA that protect patients' privacy.

## Governance in Azure

### Scope 
The level of hierarchy which will form azure environment.
![[Pasted image 20240829162347.png | 600]]

Their can be 6 level of Management grp as well

### RBAC
Role based Access Control
This maintains who can access what and what extent.
We have certain role for subscriptions basis.
- OWNER
- Contributor
- Reader
### Benefits of RBAC roles
- just restricts who can perform what 
- the role provided at high level is inherited to children scope
- roles can be applied at any scope
- custom role can be created 

### Resource Locks
 resource locks can be used for blocking at more granular level. 
 This can be applied to any resource and at any scope like subscription or resource grp. 
 and it will also be inherited from parent scope to child scope.
 There are two types of LOCK TYPE-
 - Read Only - the user can only read the resource but cannot make any changes and delete it.
 - delete - the user cannot delete the resource.


## Policy
Real time enforcement, compliance assessment and remediation at scale.
- we can do real time policy enforcements
- policy will help monitoring and alerting.
- it can be assigned to management grp , subcription and resource grps and those will be inherited to child scope.

**Azure Governance** refers to a set of tools, services, and best practices in Microsoft Azure that help organizations manage and control their cloud resources effectively. It ensures that all resources in Azure (like virtual machines, databases, and storage) are used in a way that aligns with the organization's policies, compliance requirements, and overall goals.

### **In Simple Terms:**
Azure Governance is about **keeping your cloud environment organized, secure, and compliant**. It helps you make sure that:
- **Resources are properly organized** (e.g., by department or project).
- **Costs are controlled** and not exceeded.
- **Security policies** are enforced (e.g., who can access what).
- **Compliance requirements** are met (e.g., data handling rules).

### **Key Components of Azure Governance:**

1. **Azure Policy**:
   - Enforces rules and guidelines for resources. For example, you can create policies to ensure that only certain regions are used for deploying resources or to require specific security settings.

2. **Azure Blueprints**:
   - Provides a way to define and deploy a repeatable set of Azure resources, following a consistent set of rules and standards. It helps in setting up environments quickly while ensuring they are compliant.

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Manages who has access to Azure resources and what they can do with them. It ensures that users only have the permissions they need to do their jobs, enhancing security.

4. **Resource Tags**:
   - Helps organize and manage resources by applying labels (tags) to them. This makes it easier to categorize and search for resources, track usage, and manage costs.

5. **Management Groups**:
   - Allows you to organize and manage multiple Azure subscriptions under a single structure, applying policies and controls at a higher level, which are then inherited by all underlying subscriptions.

6. **Cost Management and Billing**:
   - Provides tools to monitor and control cloud spending. This helps organizations stay within budget and optimize their cloud costs.

### **Why is Azure Governance Important?**

- **Maintains Control**: Helps maintain control over a growing number of cloud resources and ensures they are managed according to organizational policies.
- **Improves Security**: Ensures resources are secure and access is controlled.
- **Ensures Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory requirements and standards by enforcing policies and providing audit trails.
- **Reduces Costs**: Helps monitor and control spending, avoiding unnecessary costs.

### **Summary:**
Azure Governance is like setting rules and guidelines for using cloud resources, so everything is organized, secure, compliant, and cost-effective. It helps organizations use Azure effectively while maintaining control and ensuring resources are used responsibly.
