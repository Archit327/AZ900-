### What is GRC
GRC stands for Governance - Risk - Compliance.
#### Governance
It Â is a set of policies, rules, or frameworks that a company uses to achieve its business goals. It defines the responsibilities of administrator, such as the board of directors and senior management.
A good org would have governance as in
- **Ethics** - like proper punch in punch out
- **Accountability** - the higher authority should be answerable to any mishappening
- **Information sharing** - there should be transparency in some aspect
- **Policies** - set of rules which each and every employee should take care of

#### Risk
There can be any type of risk
- Financial risk
- physical risk
- Legal Risks
- Data breach risk
A good org will have proper risk management so that they can find security loopholes.
They will have time to time risk assessment procedures to have uptodate and have full command on the Environment.

#### Compliance
