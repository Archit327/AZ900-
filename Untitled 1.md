Yes, you do need licenses for setting up and using an on-premises Domain Controller (DC) with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) in an organization. Here's a breakdown of the licensing requirements:

### Windows Server Licensing

1. **Windows Server License**:
   - **Operating System**: To create an on-premises Domain Controller, you need a licensed copy of Windows Server. Each physical server running Windows Server requires a Windows Server license.
   - **Editions**: Windows Server comes in different editions (e.g., Standard, Datacenter) with varying features and virtualization rights. Choose the edition based on your organization's needs.

2. **Client Access Licenses (CALs)**:
   - **User or Device CALs**: Each user or device accessing the Windows Server requires a Client Access License (CAL). You can choose between User CALs (licensed per user) or Device CALs (licensed per device), depending on your organization's usage patterns.
   - **AD DS Access**: Since AD DS is a core feature of Windows Server, access to the Domain Controller will require CALs.

### Additional Considerations

3. **Virtualization Rights**:
   - If you plan to run the Domain Controller as a virtual machine (VM), ensure that your Windows Server edition includes the necessary virtualization rights. For instance, the Datacenter edition allows unlimited VMs, while the Standard edition allows a limited number.

4. **Windows Server Essentials**:
   - For small organizations, Windows Server Essentials might be a cost-effective option. It includes AD DS and does not require separate CALs, but it has limitations on the number of users and devices.

5. **Licensing Programs**:
   - Microsoft offers various licensing programs (e.g., Open License, Enterprise Agreement) that might provide cost savings based on your organization's size and purchasing strategy.

### Summary

To summarize, the licensing requirements for setting up an on-premises Domain Controller with AD DS include:
