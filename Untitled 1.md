security our single agent unified

with a six times reduction in security

0:20

consoles and agents with integrated

threat intelligence hunting and incident

0:25

response expertise built

0:27

in we've always said you don't have a

0:30

malware problem you have an adversary

0:33

problem bitwise spider a sophisticated

0:37

adversary known for ransomware and data

0:39

theft targets a member of your team with

0:41

a fishing attack that includes a

0:43

malicious attachment let's see how the

0:46

platform stops an attack in real time

0:49

when the attachment is opened in

0:50

Microsoft Outlook adversary establishes

0:53

a connection from their command and

0:54

control server gaining full control of

0:56

the user's system the Falcon dashboard

0:59

gives you visibility into all adversary

1:02

activity so you can start with the

1:04

highest priority threats bitwise spiders

1:07

fishing attack is marked as a critical

1:09

detection with all key context available

1:11

in a single

1:13

view the process tree assembles the full

1:16

attack trajectory tracing it from

1:18

Microsoft Outlook to the adversary's

1:20

Powershell script and all impacted files

1:22

for Rapid

1:24

investigations you get complete

1:26

visibility into how each threat maps to

1:28

the miter attack framework and a

1:30

complete description of the attack

1:32

bitwise spyer attempted to execute a

1:34

file called payroll. exe with a command

1:37

prompt which was stopped instantly by

1:39

crowd strike's Advanced on sensor

1:42

machine learning engine the file is

1:44

automatically quarantined and sent to

1:46

the Falcon intelligence sandbox for

1:48

analysis extracting all key indicators

1:51

and returning a high threat score

1:53

driving further

1:54

prioritization stop bitwise spider from

1:57

moving laterally by severing their

1:59

connection into the command and control

2:01

server preventing further malicious

2:03

action then remediate the host by

2:06

stopping the command prompt that spawn

2:08

the malicious file with a real-time

2:10

response command executed directly on

2:12

the endpoint the process has been

2:14

terminated containing the attack and

2:16

stopping the

2:18

breach now that you've stopped the

2:20

adversary on the endpoint use the xdr

2:22

incident workbench to correlate threat

2:25

activity across Cloud mobile identity

2:28

and data protection to further reduce

2:30

the attack surface the buil-in AI

2:33

investigator provides an easy toand

2:35

summary of the attack and can uncover

2:38

additional related context for your xdr

2:40

incident graph such as highlighting

2:42

other impacted systems then you can

2:45

fully close the loop with cross-domain

2:48

response actions such as adding a

2:49

compromised identity account to a watch

2:51

list to force multiactor authentication

2:54

all from one unified command
