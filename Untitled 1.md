Yes, you do need licenses for setting up and using an on-premises Domain Controller (DC) with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) in an organization. Here's a breakdown of the licensing requirements:

### Windows Server Licensing

1. **Windows Server License**:
   - **Operating System**: To create an on-premises Domain Controller, you need a licensed copy of Windows Server. Each physical server running Windows Server requires a Windows Server license.
   - **Editions**: Windows Server comes in different editions (e.g., Standard, Datacenter) with varying features and virtualization rights. Choose the edition based on your organization's needs.

2. **Client Access Licenses (CALs)**:
   - **User or Device CALs**: Each user or device accessing the Windows Server requires a Client Access License (CAL). You can choose between User CALs (licensed per user) or Device CALs (licensed per device), depending on your organization's usage patterns.
   - **AD DS Access**: Since AD DS is a core feature of Windows Server, access to the Domain Controller will require CALs.

### Additional Considerations

3. **Virtualization Rights**:
   - If you plan to run the Domain Controller as a virtual machine (VM), ensure that your Windows Server edition includes the necessary virtualization rights. For instance, the Datacenter edition allows unlimited VMs, while the Standard edition allows a limited number.

4. **Windows Server Essentials**:
   - For small organizations, Windows Server Essentials might be a cost-effective option. It includes AD DS and does not require separate CALs, but it has limitations on the number of users and devices.

5. **Licensing Programs**:
   - Microsoft offers various licensing programs (e.g., Open License, Enterprise Agreement) that might provide cost savings based on your organization's size and purchasing strategy.

### Summary

To summarize, the licensing requirements for setting up an on-premises Domain Controller with AD DS include:

- A Windows Server license for each physical or virtual server running the Domain Controller.
- Client Access Licenses (CALs) for each user or device accessing the server.
- Choosing the appropriate edition of Windows Server based on your needs.

Ensure you review Microsoft's licensing documentation or consult with a Microsoft licensing specialist to get detailed and up-to-date information tailored to your specific situation.

### how do we assign these licenses while creating the DCs and users and devices inside it

Assigning licenses for a Domain Controller (DC) and users/devices in an organization involves several steps, typically managed through your organization's IT and software asset management processes. Here's a detailed guide on how to manage and ensure compliance with licensing requirements:

### 1. Windows Server Licensing for Domain Controllers

#### Purchasing Licenses
- **Purchase Windows Server Licenses**: Obtain the required number of Windows Server licenses through a Microsoft licensing provider. Choose the appropriate edition (Standard, Datacenter, or Essentials) based on your needs.

#### Installation and Activation
- **Install Windows Server**: During the installation of Windows Server on your physical or virtual machine, you'll be prompted to enter the product key. This product key is part of your Windows Server license.
- **Activate Windows Server**: After installation, activate Windows Server using the product key. This can typically be done through the Windows Activation interface in the Settings menu or via command line tools for bulk activation.

### 2. Assigning Client Access Licenses (CALs)

#### Types of CALs
- **User CALs**: A User CAL is assigned to a specific user, allowing them to access the server from any device.
- **Device CALs**: A Device CAL is assigned to a specific device, allowing any number of users to access the server from that device.

#### Managing CALs
- **Purchase CALs**: Obtain the necessary number of CALs based on your user and device count.
- **Documentation**: Keep a detailed record of CAL assignments, whether user or device CALs. This is important for compliance and auditing purposes.
- **Software Asset Management Tools**: Utilize software asset management (SAM) tools to help track and manage CAL usage. These tools can provide insights into license allocation and compliance status.

### 3. Creating Domain Controllers and Users

#### Setting Up Domain Controllers
- **Install AD DS Role**: On your licensed Windows Server, install the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role using the Server Manager.
- **Promote to Domain Controller**: Use the AD DS configuration wizard to promote the server to a Domain Controller. During this process, you will configure the domain and associated settings.

#### Creating and Managing Users and Devices
- **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**: Use the ADUC tool to create and manage user accounts and devices within your domain.
  - **User Accounts**: Create user accounts and ensure each user has a corresponding User CAL, if applicable.
  - **Devices**: Register devices and ensure each device has a corresponding Device CAL, if applicable.

### 4. Ensuring Compliance

#### License Compliance
- **Regular Audits**: Perform regular audits of your licenses and usage to ensure compliance. This includes verifying that the number of CALs matches the number of users or devices accessing the servers.
- **SAM Tools**: Implement SAM tools that can help automate tracking and management of licenses. These tools often provide dashboards and reports to monitor compliance.

#### Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC)
- **License Management**: If you are using volume licensing, manage your licenses through the Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC). Here, you can track your purchases, download license keys, and monitor usage.

### Summary

1. **Windows Server Licensing**:
   - Purchase appropriate Windows Server licenses.
   - Install and activate Windows Server with the provided product key.

2. **Client Access Licenses (CALs)**:
   - Purchase User or Device CALs as needed.
   - Document and manage CAL assignments using SAM tools.

3. **Domain Controllers and AD Setup**:
   - Install AD DS role on the licensed Windows Server.
   - Promote the server to a Domain Controller.
   - Use ADUC to create and manage user accounts and devices.

4. **Compliance**:
   - Regularly audit your license usage.
   - Use VLSC and SAM tools to ensure ongoing compliance.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage the licensing for your on-premises Domain Controllers and ensure that your organization remains compliant with Microsoft's licensing requirements.
