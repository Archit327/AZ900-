This section we discuss about the creation of users and , giving roles to them and what are permissions required for the user and how to add.


### Who can create USER in falcon

- To create users and assign roles to them, you must have an administrative role, such as ==Falcon Administrator==.
- ==The Falcon Security Lead== can reset user passwords and MFA, but cannot manage users or user roles.

## Understanding user accounts

A user account contains attributes that identify a user and determine which resources they can access. It defines the user’s name, the unique email address that’s used to log in to Falcon, and the roles, groups, and CIDs the user is assigned to.

A unique user account is required for every person in your organization who needs access to the Falcon console. In a Flight Control environment, if a user requires access to more than one CID, you can associate the same user account with multiple CIDs in the Flight Control deployment.
