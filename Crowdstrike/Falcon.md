## Crowdstrike Falcon
### Endpoint SecurityÂ 
### what is falcon?
- Crowdstrike Falcon is a cloud based, next generation endpoint protection solution.
- Falcon provides software as a service.
- it provides advanced detection, prevention, monitoring and search capabilities, allowing analysts to defend against sophisticated threats and adversaries.
- It offers remote visibility across endpoints throughout an environment.
- It gives very detail info about the attack like who,what,when,why,where and how the attack.
- ### How does Falcon works?
- Falcons uses two things to make its work done
==1. Sensor
2.Endpoint cloud portal==

- falcon has billions of sensors deployed over 80billion endpoint events in over 176 countries.
- falcon uses the sensors to fetch the info from the endpoints or the device in which its installed and send it to cloud portal for the analysis and other monitoring tasks.
- Falcon sensor is a lightweight sensor which is deployed into the endpoint without affecting the endpoint performance.
- It gathers the info from the endpoints and takes proactive detection and preventions actions.- The sensors detects and defends the attacks occurring on the disks.
- The platform continuously watches for suspicious processes, events, and activities, wherever they reside
- form the platform we can do advance protection like allowing and blocking sites customly just like nsgs in azure vm.
### WHat happens to the data send to the falcon endpoint detction portal?
- the data extracted from the device is send to the portal by sensors.
- then this data is analysed and will draw some link between the events triggered and the data.
- Here falcon uses Crowdstrike threat graph data model., whoch will analyzes and detects the new threat.

### Capabilities of Falcon

- Cloud based antivirus (Cloud AV)-
  for known threats falcon provides cloud antivirus
- Indicators of attack (IOA) detection-
  for known threats falcon provides cloud antivirus
  for unknown and zero-day threats falcon provides IOA detection(Indicator of attack). IOA uses AI and ML to build models which will predict the never seen before threats and malicious activities with high accuracy .
- Crowdstrike's Threat Graph data model-
  this generates graph based patterns which helps the predictive models of IOA to get insights and be more accurate.
