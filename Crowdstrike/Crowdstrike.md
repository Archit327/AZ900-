## What is Crowdstrike ?

Crowdstrike is a cyber security providibg company which is highly specialised in providing Endpoint Security.
Founded in 2011 by George Kurtz and Dmitri Alperovitch.

## What is the use of Crowdstrike?
SO it basically provides the security to our servers or machines. So with the help of the Crowdstrike we can protect our machine from attacks like malware, viruses and network attacks.
With the help of its AI it can proactively protect our machine from threats.

## How does Crowdstrike work?
Crowdstrike provides big business organisation with advanced security solution to protect their servers or machine form getting attacked.
The updates and scans are done automatically by the crowdstrike.

### NEED for Crowdstrike EDR solution?

Few years from now Antivirus software and firewalls were more than sufficient to defense the attacks.
However, the recent increase in cybercrime and the development of sophisticated strategies call for a multi-layered approach to security.
Endpoint detection and response (EDR) by crowdstrike is as implied by the name. But compared to SIEM, it has various features. Physical endpoints on a network include laptops, servers, cellphones, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices. They serve as sort of doors into an organization. They are particularly susceptible to deliberate, targeted attacks.
Crowdstrike Falcon works proactively rather than reactive i.e it is ready from before the attcak can enter or threat is created to the environment. Not like once the Attack is done then it will start its analysis and response against that attack

### The Difference between EDR and SIEM

There are several significant differences between EDR and SIEM’s performance and capabilities outside of their main functions.

The main purposes of SIEM tools are to collect event logs and offer actionable security information. On one platform, all security intelligence from all sources is accessible. Continuous detection and response at the endpoint level against ransomware, fileless attacks, or malware is the main goal of EDR.

- **Data Gathering:** EDR only gathers data from endpoints. Apart from endpoints, SIEM gathers data from numerous sources. The network, users, applications, cloud, and on-premise infrastructure are all included in the multi-layered approach to log gathering.
- **Threat Hunting:** Because there are several sources for log gathering, there are various levels of log analysis as well. SIEM uses machine learning to filter enormous amounts of log data and provide custom analytical criteria. EDR may overlap with SIEM findings because it only collects data from endpoints.

## Crowd strike endpoint security with Scenario
crowd strike is a EDR soluiton provider with an adversary focused approach to Modern endpoint security.
This unified platform improves response Times by 95% with a six times reduction in security consoles and agents with integrated threat intelligence hunting and incident response expertise built in.

It is  always said you don't have a malware problem you have an adversary problem for example ==Bitwise spider== 

#### Bitwise Spider
A sophisticated adversary known for ransomware and data theft targets a member of your team with a fishing attack that includes a malicious attachment.

### How does Bitwise Spider attacks and how Falcon response to it?

let's see how the platform stops an attack in real time.
1. So when the attachment is opened in Microsoft Outlook by any employee then adversary establishes a connection from their command and control server gaining full control of the user's system.
2. The Falcon dashboard gives you visibility into all adversary activity,so you can start with the highest priority threats.
3. Bitwise spiders fishing attack is marked as a critical detection with all key context available in a single view.
4. ==Process tree== assembles the full attack trajectory tracing it from Microsoft Outlook to the adversary's Powershell script and all impacted files for Rapid investigations.
5. This mapping like inteface will help you get complete visibility into how each threat maps to the miter attack framework and a complete description of the attack. Forexample after gaining the access to the users machine the adversary tries to execute a file called infraSecurity.exe with a command prompt.
6. Which will be stopped instantly by crowd strike's. 
7. Here with help of sensor machine learning engine the ==file is automatically quarantined and sent to the Falcon intelligence sandbox for analysis== 
8. In sandbox the file is explored for extracting all key indicators and generate a high threat score driving further prioritization stop bitwise spider from moving laterally by severing their connection into the command and control server preventing further malicious action.
9. Then remediate the host by ==stopping the command prompt that spawn the malicious file== with a real-time response command executed directly on the endpoint. 
   The process has been terminated containing the attack and stopping the breach
10. Now that you've stopped the adversary on the endpoint, use the ==xdr incident workbench== to correlate threat activity across Cloud mobile identity and data protection to further reduce the attack surface.
11. The buil-in AI investigator provides an easy end to end summary of the attack and can uncover additional related context for your xdr incident graph such as highlighting other impacted systems.
12. Then you can fully close the loop with cross-domain response actions such as ==adding a compromised identity account to a watch list to force multiactor authentication== all from one unified command console industry leading security that's easy to deploy and operate all while cutting complexity and cost that's crowd strike contact us to learn how you can stop adversaries faster with crowd strike endpoint security.

## what is the prupose and what do we get from falcon for running those purpose?

So the main key aspect of crwodstrike falcon is that within the given environment the breaches should be stopped and preidentified.

So basically stopping the breaches to occur it the environment.

### What do we get to use to stop breach?

So falcon provides bunch of tools and features for securing the environment and monitoring proactively.

- Endpoint protection - next Gen AV (falcon prevent), usb control(falcon device control), falcon firewall management
- Threat Intelligence - Threat intel, search
- Security Operation - Threat hunting(falcon adversary overwatch), IT hygiene(falcon discover), vulnerability management
