Here’s a breakdown of the licensing option you’re referring to:

- **Azure Hybrid Benefit**: This allows you to use your existing on-premises Windows Server licenses with Software Assurance to save costs on Azure VMs. If you select this option, Azure will apply your existing license, and you won’t be charged for a new Windows Server license as part of the VM cost.

Given the company's requirement that they do not want to use their Software Assurance licenses for the Azure VMs and instead want the VM price with the license included, you should **not tick the option for Azure Hybrid Benefit**.

### Steps for Deployment:
1. **Deploy the VM**: Go through the steps to create a new VM in Azure.
2. **Licensing Section**: When you reach the "Licensing" section on the basics page:
   - **Do not tick the option** that asks if you would like to use an existing Windows Server license.

By not ticking this option, Azure will include the cost of the Windows Server license in the VM price, and Microsoft will provide the necessary license for the server.

### Summary:
- **Ticking the Option**: Use an existing license, no additional cost for Windows Server license (Azure Hybrid Benefit).
- **Not Ticking the Option**: Do not use an existing license, VM price includes the Windows Server license.

In your case, since the company wants the license included in the VM cost, you should proceed without selecting the Azure Hybrid Benefit option.

When you deploy a Windows Server VM in Azure without using the Azure Hybrid Benefit, the licensing is handled by Microsoft, and the cost of the license is included in the VM pricing. There is no separate license key provided to you, as the licensing is managed by Azure as part of the VM provisioning process. Here’s how you can confirm that the VM is properly licensed:

### Steps to Confirm Licensing in an Azure Windows Server VM

1. **Azure Portal Verification**:
    - **VM Overview**: Navigate to the VM’s overview page in the Azure portal.
    - **Billing**: Review the VM pricing details to ensure the Windows Server license cost is included. This confirms that Microsoft is providing the license as part of the VM cost.

2. **Check Windows Activation Status Inside the VM**:
    - **Connect to the VM**: Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to connect to your Windows Server VM.
    - **System Properties**: 
        - Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" and select "Properties."
        - Scroll down to the "Windows activation" section.
        - You should see a message indicating that "Windows is activated" along with the product ID and activation status.
    - **Command Prompt**:
        - Open Command Prompt as an administrator.
        - Run the command `slmgr /dlv` to display detailed license information.
        - This should show the activation status and that the Windows Server is licensed under Azure's licensing agreement.

### Example Commands:

- **Activation Status**:
  ```shell
  slmgr /xpr
  ```
  This command will show whether the machine is activated permanently.

- **Detailed License Information**:
  ```shell
  slmgr /dlv
  ```
  This command will display detailed license information, including the license status and type.

### Summary:

- **Azure Manages the License**: When you deploy a VM with the license included, Azure manages the Windows Server license, and you don’t receive a separate license key.
- **Activation Confirmation**: Inside the VM, you can check the Windows activation status via the System Properties or using `slmgr` commands to ensure the VM is properly licensed.

By following these steps, you can verify that the Windows Server license provided by Microsoft is active and properly configured in your Azure VM.

Differentiating between a Windows Server license provided by Microsoft (as part of an Azure VM with licensing included) and a license owned by the organization and applied through Azure Hybrid Benefit involves checking the activation and licensing details of the VM. Here’s how you can do this:

### 1. **Check Activation Status Using Command Prompt**

You can use the Software Licensing Management Tool (slmgr) to get detailed information about the licensing status of the server.

- **Connect to the VM** using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
- **Open Command Prompt as an administrator**.
- **Run the following commands**:
  - `slmgr /xpr`:
    - This command checks if the Windows installation is permanently activated.
    - If the server is activated with a license provided by Microsoft through Azure, it will show that the Windows is activated and usually will not provide specifics about a particular license key.
    
  - `slmgr /dlv`:
    - This command displays detailed license information, including the activation ID, application ID, and license status.
    - For a VM with an organization’s license applied through Azure Hybrid Benefit, it will typically show information indicating the use of a volume license key (VLK) or KMS (Key Management Service).

### 2. **Review Licensing Details in the Azure Portal**

- **Navigate to the VM’s Overview Page** in the Azure portal.
- **Check the Licensing Section**:
  - If the VM was created with Azure Hybrid Benefit, this should be indicated in the VM’s properties.
  - The billing section should show that the VM is using Azure Hybrid Benefit, meaning the organization’s existing license is being used.

### 3. **System Properties**

- **Open System Properties**:
  - Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" and select "Properties".
  - Scroll down to the "Windows activation" section.
  - If using Azure Hybrid Benefit, the product ID and activation status might reference volume licensing or KMS, rather than showing a retail or OEM product key.

### 4. **Check Licensing Type in the Azure Portal**

- **Azure Cost Management and Billing**:
  - Go to "Cost Management + Billing" in the Azure portal.
  - Check the cost breakdown for the VM.
  - If the VM is using an organization’s license through Azure Hybrid Benefit, the cost for the Windows Server license should not be included in the VM pricing.

### Summary:

- **Licenses Provided by Microsoft**:
  - Typically show as activated without specific volume licensing details.
  - The cost of the license is included in the VM pricing.

- **Organization-Owned Licenses (Azure Hybrid Benefit)**:
  - Detailed information in `slmgr /dlv` may show volume licensing or KMS activation.
  - Indicated in the VM properties and Azure billing details.
  - No separate cost for the Windows Server license in the VM pricing.

By following these steps, you can determine whether a Windows Server license on an Azure VM is provided by Microsoft or if it is an organization-owned license applied via Azure Hybrid Benefit.
