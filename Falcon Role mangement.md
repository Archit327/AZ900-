These role are applied to the falcon console users.
To create this falcon role one should have Falcon ADministrator role.

Falcon also works on Role based access control.

### Falcon RBAC
Basically consists of two elements:
- permissions- these are nothing but the checks whether the particular user trying to access something in portal does have the required acces to it or not. Permissions are just collected in permissions groups in falcon console such as prevention policies.
- roles- These are nothing but the collection of different permissons, so if the user wnats certain level of access in the portal thne it will provided with appropriate role which has required permisssion to perform that task successfully.
  - default role - already builtin role like Flacon ADMinistrator, these role are provided by the crowdstrike itself and cannot be updated.
  - custom role - the org can make role according to the permission or access they need to have for performing a certain task.
