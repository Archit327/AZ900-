Crowdstrike is a cyber security providibg company which is highly specialised in providing Endpoint Security.
Founded in 2011 by George Kurtz and Dmitri Alperovitch.

## What is the use of Crowdstrike?
SO it basically provides the security to our servers or machines. So with the help of the Crowdstrike we can protect our machine from attacks like malware, viruses and network attacks.
With the help of its AI it can proactively protect our machine from threats.

## How does Crowdstrike work?
Crowdstrike provides big business organisation with advanced security solution to protect their servers or machine form getting attacked.
The updates and scans are done automatically by the crowdstrike.

### NEED for Crowdstrike EDR solution?

Few years from now Antivirus software and firewalls were more than sufficient to defense the attacks.
However, the recent increase in cybercrime and the development of sophisticated strategies call for a multi-layered approach to security.
Endpoint detection and response (EDR) by crowdstrike is as implied by the name. But compared to SIEM, it has various features. Physical endpoints on a network include laptops, servers, cellphones, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices. They serve as sort of doors into an organization. They are particularly susceptible to deliberate, targeted attacks.
Crowdstrike Falcon works proactively rather than reactive i.e it is ready from before the attcak can enter or threat is created to the environment. Not like once the Attack is done then it will start its analysis and response against that attack

### The Difference between EDR and SIEM

There are several significant differences between EDR and SIEM’s performance and capabilities outside of their main functions.

The main purposes of SIEM tools are to collect event logs and offer actionable security information. On one platform, all security intelligence from all sources is accessible. Continuous detection and response at the endpoint level against ransomware, fileless attacks, or malware is the main goal of EDR.

- **Data Gathering:** EDR only gathers data from endpoints. Apart from endpoints, SIEM gathers data from numerous sources. The network, users, applications, cloud, and on-premise infrastructure are all included in the multi-layered approach to log gathering.
- **Threat Hunting:** Because there are several sources for log gathering, there are various levels of log analysis as well. SIEM uses machine learning to filter enormous amounts of log data and provide custom analytical criteria. EDR may overlap with SIEM findings because it only collects data from endpoints.
