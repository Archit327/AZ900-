## Security Consideration for Azure VMware Solution

This pillar is concerned with implementing measures that help protect your workload from threats. Examples include adding multiple security layers to your applications, including identity and access management (IAM), input validation, data sovereignty, and encryption for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) mitigation. Other measures include blocking bad actors, preventing data exfiltration, and providing protection from operating system vulnerabilities.

In a shared-responsibility model:
- Organizations are primarily responsible for managing and operating workloads.
- Microsoft manages the physical and virtual infrastructure of Azure VMware Solution.

You can employ several methods to secure your Azure VMware Solution environment:

- Monitor security with a security information and event management (SIEM) solution like Microsoft Sentinel.
- Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- Use robust IAM practices:
    - Enforce multi-factor authentication.
    - Integrate your workload with Microsoft Entra ID.
    - Implement the principle of least privilege, and use role-based access control to assign roles.
- Maintaining documentation  that captures:
    - Troubleshooting procedures.
    - Actionable reports.
    - Disaster recovery plans.
    - Remediation guidance on how to accelerate the process of resolving problems.
- Using SIEM tools for threat detection and response
- using Defender for cloud -  threat management, endpoint protection, security alerting, OS patching, and a centralized view into regulatory compliance enforcement
 
### Protect the guest operating system

If you don't patch and regularly update your operating system, you make it susceptible to vulnerabilities and put your entire platform at risk. 
When you apply patches regularly, you keep your system up to date. 
When you also use an endpoint protection solution, you help to prevent common attack vectors from targeting your operating system. 
It's also important to regularly perform vulnerability scans and assessments. 
These tools help you identify and remediate security weaknesses and vulnerabilities.Microsoft Defender for Cloud offers unique tools that provide advanced threat protection across Azure VMware Solution and on-premises VMs, including:

- File integrity monitoring.
- Fileless attack detection.
- Operating system patch assessment.
- Security misconfiguration assessment.
- Endpoint protection assessment.
##### Recommendations

- Install an Azure security agent on Azure VMware Solution guest VMs through Azure Arc for servers to monitor them for security configurations and vulnerabilities.
- Configure Azure Arc machines to automatically create an association with the default data collection rule for Defender for Cloud.
- On the subscription that you use to deploy and run the Azure VMware Solution private cloud, use a Defender for Cloud plan that includes protection for servers.
- If you have guest VMs with extended security benefits in the Azure VMware Solution private cloud, deploy security updates regularly. Use the Volume Activation Management Tool to deploy these updates.

### Encrypt data

Data encryption is an important aspect of protecting your Azure VMware Solution workload from unauthorized access and preserving the integrity of sensitive data. Encryption includes data at rest on the systems and data in transit.
##### Recommendations

- Encrypt VMware vSAN datastores with customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest.
- Use native encryption tools such as BitLocker to encrypt guest VMs.
- Use native database encryption options for databases that run on Azure VMware Solution private cloud guest VMs. For instance, you can use transparent data encryption (TDE) for SQL Server.
- Monitor database activities for suspicious activity. You can use native database monitoring tools like SQL Server Activity Monitor for this purpose.


### Monitor security and detect threats

Security monitoring and threat detection involve detecting and responding to changes in the security posture of Azure VMware Solution private cloud workloads. It's important to follow industry best practices and comply with regulatory requirements, including:

- The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).

You can use a security information and event management (SIEM) tool or Microsoft Sentinel to aggregate, monitor, and analyze security logs and events. This information helps you detect and respond to potential threats. Regularly conducting audit reviews also helps you avert threats. When you regularly monitor your Azure VMware Solution environment, you're in a better position to ensure it aligns with security standards and policies.
##### Recommendations

- Automate responses to recommendations from Defender for Cloud by using the following Azure policies:
    - Workflow automation for security alerts
    - Workflow automation for security recommendations
    - Workflow automation for regulatory compliance changes
- Deploy Microsoft Sentinel and set the destination to a Log Analytics workspace to collect logs from Azure VMware Solution private cloud guest VMs.
- Use a data connector to connect Microsoft Sentinel and Defender for Cloud.
- Automate threat responses by using Microsoft Sentinel playbooks and Azure Automation rules.


### Use role-based access control (RBAC) and multifactor authentication

Identity security helps control access to Azure VMware Solution private cloud workloads and the applications that run on them. You can use RBAC to assign roles and permissions that are appropriate for specific users and groups. These roles and permissions are granted based on the principle of least privilege.

You can enforce multifactor authentication for user authentication to provide an extra layer of security against unauthorized access. Various multifactor authentication methods, such as mobile push notifications, offer a convenient user experience and also help to ensure strong authentication. You can integrate Azure VMware Solution with Microsoft Entra ID to centralize user management and take advantage of Microsoft Entra advanced security features. Examples of features include privileged identity management, multifactor authentication, and conditional access.
##### Recommendations

- Use Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management to allow time-bound access to the Azure portal and control pane operations.
- Use privileged identity management audit history to track operations that highly privileged accounts perform.
- Reduce the number of Microsoft Entra accounts that can:
    - Access the Azure portal and APIs.
    - Navigate to the Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
    - Read VMware vCenter Server and VMware NSX-T Data Center admin accounts.
- Rotate local `cloudadmin` account credentials for VMware vCenter Server and VMware NSX-T Data Center to prevent the misuse and abuse of these administrative accounts. Use these accounts only in _break glass_ scenarios. 
- Create server groups and users for VMware vCenter Server, and assign them identities from external identity sources. Use these groups and users for specific VMware vCenter Server and VMware NSX-T Data Center operations.
- Use a centralized identity source for configuring authentication and authorization services for guest VMs and applications.
