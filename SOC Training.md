## SOC

- The primary objective of a SOC is to maintain the ==confidentiality, integrity, and availability== of an organizationâ€™s systems and data. 
- It achieves this by ==identifying, investigating, and responding== to security incidents promptly and effectively. This proactive approach helps minimize the impact of security breaches, ensuring business continuity and reducing financial losses.
- SOC plays a crucial role in incident response management. When a security incident occurs, the SOC team takes charge of coordinating the response efforts, ensuring that the incident is contained, analyzed, and remediated in a timely manner. 
- This includes identifying the root cause of the incident, implementing necessary measures to prevent similar incidents in the future, and providing guidance to stakeholders on how to improve their security posture.
