WHen we talk about on premises that time each and every company need to take care of their data and security of their network by their own and which was a very complex task for the companies to handle the extra work which was not to be required by the company to handle . It was like extra work to them. they hv to manage the datacentre all the databases and networking and security related stuff by their own , they hav to spend a lot of time on their backend and human effort also, they hire a well qualified grp of people who will mange their datacentre and network security.


But if some miss happenning happen in the company or in the location of the company the data might get destroyed , and getting again becomes next to impossible .

some companies also buy very costly hrdware to maintain their servers so that they dont get runout when their is high peak in the market for that company , but as the peak is over the company doesnt use those server again untill the time again comes and hence just waste the hardware kept null.

These some of the problems wre solved by the cloud , cloud gave the companies and users the feature of storing therur data in cloud and also use the network provided by cloud providers, use the machines from cloud which can never fail at the time of peak in their company.

Cloud provider like AZURE keep ur data as personel and protected as its their own and provide the infra facility to the customers which will definately make the efforts of the usre less and relaxed.

AZURE provide more than 200++ services and in every aspect a user might think of. for example Compute ,storage , networking.
