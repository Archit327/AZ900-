Of course, there’s much more to solar installation than slapping up panels: there’s general contracting, roofing, metal fabrication, sales, repair and maintenance, consultation, landscape design, and so much more.

Starting a solar business doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need a crew up on roofs installing panels. If sales is your thing, there are many businesses that focus on just that. 

These companies do all the work of [selling solar systems](https://aurorasolar.com/sales-mode/): getting leads, qualifying them, doing in-home or virtual consultations, and getting the customer to sign. Once a customer has signed on, these organizations then work with a contractor that takes care of the rest of the installation process.

With the recent improvements in solar sales software, it’s easier than ever to stand out from the crowd. Click through this Tourial to see how Aurora’s reimagined Sales Mode can help you sell with confidence and close more sales.

### Solar installers

Solar installers are usually the most saturated business in the market. If you’re wondering how to start a [solar installation business](https://aurorasolar.com/aurora-for-installers/), you might want to start at the basics: Roofing. If you’re a roofer, solar installation could be a great option to add to your business. The [solar and roofing industries](https://www.altenergymag.com/article/2019/06/the-convergence-of-the-roofing-and-solar-industries/31129) are starting to converge, and for good reason. Solar panels and roofs have about the same lifespan (approximately 25 years), and savvy roofers are realizing the one-two punch of installing a new roof and solar system simultaneously. Whether you’re a roofing contractor or solar installer, there’s a lot of overlap between the two, and plenty of untapped market opportunities for incorporating roofing and solar into your business plan.

### What is a PV system?

Before we move on, let’s take a quick look at [how a PV system works](https://www.aurorasolar.com/blog/how-a-photovoltaic-system-produces-electricity/) to get a better idea of how you can make money building one.

#### How does a solar photovoltaic system work?

Solar panels convert the energy of the sun into electricity through a process called the photovoltaic effect. When a photon hits a photovoltaic (PV) device, its energy knocks electrons in the material. These electrons begin to flow, producing an electric current.

At a high level, the process of how solar panels works involves three primary steps:

- Solar cells within solar panels absorb light from the sun, which causes electric current to begin flowing.
- An inverter converts [DC electricity to AC electricity](https://www.aurorasolar.com/blog/solar-fundamentals-whats-the-difference-between-ac-vs-dc/).
- This electricity is used to supply current energy demands in the customer’s building and excess electricity beyond what the customer can use is exported to the grid (or used to charge a battery).

The photovoltaic process occurs at the solar cell level. Solar panels are composed of multiple cells, and PV systems are a series of solar panels wired together (called “[stringing](https://www.aurorasolar.com/blog/solar-panel-wiring-basics-an-intro-to-how-to-string-solar-panels/)”) to provide appropriate voltage to the system’s inverter.

After a [PV system is installed](https://aurorasolar.com/blog/how-to-install-solar-panels/), there’s nothing standing between a customer and cheap, green energy.

PARTS of Solar panels: 
It is common practice to refer to the remaining parts of a PV system (besides the modules) as balance of system (BOS) components. Examples of BOS components include:

- Inverters
- Disconnects
- Racking
- Wiring


Some of the main environmental factors that can negatively impact solar panel efficiency include:

- [Temperature](https://www.aurorasolar.com/blog/understanding-pv-system-losses-part-4-tilt-orientation-incident-angle-modifier-environmental-conditions-and-inverter-losses-clipping#temperature-losses-solar): Solar panel efficiency is inversely proportional to temperature. This means that the hotter it becomes outside, the less solar efficient solar modules become (with all other factors held equal).
- [Soiling](https://www.aurorasolar.com/blog/understanding-pv-system-losses-part-3-soiling-snow-system-degradation#soiling-solar): Material that accumulates on the surface of PV panels can block sunlight from reaching the solar cells, reducing the amount of power they can generate. These energy losses are highly variable and depend both on the type of soiling (i.e. dust, pollen, or [snow](https://www.aurorasolar.com/blog/your-guide-to-monthly-snow-loss-values-from-nrel)) and how frequently the panels are cleaned and maintained. Soiling, such as dust, on PV modules reduces power output.

- Shading, as you might have guessed, is what happens when surrounding trees, buildings, terrain, and other objects partially or fully block sunlight from hitting a PV system. The effect of shading on solar power output is highly variable.   
    
- Wiring and connections: Resistance in the electrical connections of a solar installation typically results in energy losses of a few percent.  
    
- Mismatching Due to manufacturing variations, modules of the same type can have slightly different electrical characteristics. This mismatch between modules can lead to performance losses.  
    
- Inverter efficiency - converting DC into AC via an inverter is typically around 96-97% efficient. Solar inverters typically enjoy improved conversion efficiency rates when the DC input power is high. However, conversion rates take a big hit when the input is much less than the inverter’s rated power.  
    
- [Age](https://www.aurorasolar.com/blog/understanding-pv-system-losses-part-3-soiling-snow-system-degradation#solar-system-degradation): All solar panels degrade with time — producing less energy the older they get. This decrease in performance is typically factored into the PV module manufacturer’s linear 25-year warranty, with most degradation rates hovering around 0.5% per year.


**Solar Licensing and Certification Overview**

**Licensing:**  
Not all states require a solar license, but some do—especially if you plan to work outside your home state. Licensing requirements vary by location and may include an electrician or plumbing license, or a dedicated solar contractor license. Always check with your local or state authority to confirm what’s required.

**Certification:**  
Even where a license isn’t required, getting certified is highly recommended. Solar certifications build customer trust, increase your credibility, and can boost your income—certified professionals earn an average of $11,000 more per year. Certification may also allow you to work across more states or municipalities.

**NABCEP Certifications:**  
The **North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP)** offers nationally recognized certifications for PV professionals, including:

- **PV Installation Professional (PVIP)**
    
- **PV Design Specialist (PVDS)**
    
- **PV Technical Sales Professional (PVTS)**
    
- **PV Installer Specialist (PVIS)**
    
- **PV Commissioning & Maintenance Specialist (PVCMS)**
    
- **PV System Inspector (PVSI)**
    

These credentials demonstrate verified skills, experience, and professional competence in the solar industry.
