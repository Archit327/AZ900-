### Scene 1: The Night Shift Begins
**Frustrated Employee**: (yawning, adjusting the thermostat) How is it so cold in here? Are we storing penguins?

**Colleague 1**: (walks by) I like it this way. Keeps me awake.

**Frustrated Employee**: (shivers) Feels like Antarctica. (cranks up the heat)

**Colleague 2**: (from across the room) Who touched the AC? It’s like a Biryani handi now.

**Frustrated Employee**: (grumbling) Just trying not to freeze over.

**Colleague 1:** Better than sweating buckets!

### Scene 2: The Computer Issue
**Frustrated Employee**: (sits at desk, computer screen blank) Great, now the computer is dead too. like my social life(sighs, picks up the phone to call tech support)

### Scene 3: The Tech Support Call
**Tech Support**: (heavy accent) Thank you for calling tech support. How may I be assisting you tonight?

**Frustrated Employee**: (struggling to understand) Uh, hi. My computer isn’t working at all.(mockery tone)

**Tech Support**: Is it plugged in?

**Frustrated Employee**: (confused) Pugs? No, I don’t have any pets. 

**Tech Support**: No, no. Plugged in. Is it connected to the power?

**Frustrated Employee**: (rolls eyes) Yeah, of course it's plugged in. (sigh)

### Scene 4: The Lights Off Scare
**Colleague 1**: (sneaks to the light switch and turns off the lights) Boo!

**Frustrated Employee**: (jumps, drops the phone) jai maata di!! It's just you.

**Colleague 1**: (laughing) Night shift tradition! Gotta keep things interesting.

**Tech Support**: Hello? Hello? Are you still there?

**Frustrated Employee**: (picks up the phone) Sorry, got attacked by an ugly ghost.

**Tech Support**: Ghosts? We do not cover those in tech support. You have to contact the ghost Department for it.

### Scene 5: More Misunderstandings
**Tech Support**: Press the power button.

**Frustrated Employee**: (presses random button) Power button?(mockery) Which one is that again? Oh, this one. (nothing happens) Still nothing.

**Tech Support**: (sighs) The button with the circle and line, you know? 

**Frustrated Employee**: (sarcastic) Oh, you mean the one that is entirely different than every key on the keyboard.

### Scene 6: AC Temperature Wars Continue
**Colleague 2**: (sneaks to the thermostat, adjusts it) Seriously, I’m melting here.

**Frustrated Employee**: (shivering again) Can we just pick a temperature and stick with it?

**Colleague 1**: (from the other side) Not a chance! (bickering at the AC remote with Colleague 2)

**Tech Support**: Check if the monitor is powering on. (patiently) The screen, the big thing you look at. Is it showing anything?

**Frustrated Employee**: (looking at blank screen) Nope, still blank. Like my patience. 

### Scene 7: The Realization
**Tech Support**: Okay, last thing. Check the power cord at the back of the computer.

**Frustrated Employee**: (crawls under the desk) You want me to what? Fine. (pauses) Oh... it’s not plugged in.

**Tech Support**: (sarcastically) Surprise, surprise. Plug it in, and try again.

### Scene 8: The Awkward Thanks
**Frustrated Employee**: (plugs it in, computer starts up) Oh, it’s working now. Thanks, I guess.

**Tech Support**: (cheerfully) Anytime! Just remember, always check the power first.

**Frustrated Employee**: (rolls eyes) Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Bye.

**Tech Support**: Have a wonderful night!

**Frustrated Employee**: (mutters) Sure, if I survive this job. (hangs up, adjusts thermostat again)

**Colleague 2:** Okay, the AC is perfect at 19

**Colleague 1:** OH! no way put it at 16 only 

**Frustrated Employee**: (sarcastically) Wonderful. Just wonderful.
