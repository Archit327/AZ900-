**Common Event Format (CEF)** is a standardized logging format used to simplify the process of logging security-related events and integrating logs from different sources into a single system. Here are some key points about CEF:

1. **Structured Logging Format**: CEF uses a structured data format to log events. It ensures consistency across different log sources, making it easier to analyze and correlate security events.
2. **Event Types and Severity Levels**: CEF supports a wide range of event types and severity levels. Whether it’s a firewall alert, authentication event, or any other security-related activity, CEF provides a consistent way to represent these events.
3. **Integration with SIEMs**: Most network and security systems support either Syslog or CEF for sending data to Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions. Azure Sentinel, for example, can ingest data from external solutions using CEF.
4. **Advantages of CEF**:
    - **Normalization**: CEF ensures that data is normalized, making it immediately useful for analysis in SIEM tools like Azure Sentinel.
    - **Query Time Parsing**: Unlike some other SIEM products, Azure Sentinel allows ingesting unparsed Syslog events and performing analytics on them using query time parsing.
5. **Deployment in Azure Sentinel**:
    - To configure CEF collection in Azure Sentinel, you use a Linux machine as a log forwarder between your security solution and Azure Sentinel.
    - The Log Analytics agent is installed on the Linux machine, securely relaying events to your Azure Sentinel workspace.
    - You can deploy the Linux machine on-premises, in Azure, or in other clouds.
