Difference about Availability Zone and Scale Sets

While deploying the vm check the storage available

What happens if we don't delete the files in the access tier of Blob after the number of days?

Can we update the azure disk storage types such that Standard hdd can be updated to standard ssd?Â  Temporary vs Managed disk

Priority order of the disks Disk>Blobs>Files>tables>Queues

Transaction optimized tier in azure blob storage

Can we update from grs to zrs or vice versa

Or other redundancy

GRS VS RAGRS cost vs access and need and possibilities of switching between them. (adding extra permutations of the possibilities will be better).

Why is AzCopy only unidirectional and how do you connect Azure to your CMD. What are the prerequisites?
