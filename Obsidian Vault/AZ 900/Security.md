### What is Hacking?

The act of compromising the digital devices and networks through unauthorized access to an account or computer system.
It is like an illegal activity and data theft by cyber criminals.

### What is Hacking in context to cyber security?

It is the misuse of devices like computer , smartphones, tablets and network to cause damage to the systems or corrupt the systems.
It can be gathering information or data of users or documents in malicious manner.


In this modern era Hackers are now growing increasingly , using stealthy attack methods  designed to go completely unnoticed by cybersecurity software and IT teams. They are highly skilled programmers in coding and modifying computer software and hardware systems.

#### Black Hat Hackers

These are considered as a "bad guyz" as they often try to hack the network or systems of the organisation to steal data or info , or exploit them for financial gain.
They go out of their way to discover vulnerabilities or loop holes in their network or systems, there actions can do serious damage to the computer user and the org they work for.

They try to steal valuable and sensitive information of the org  and compromise computer and financial systems .


#### White Hat Hackers

These are considered as "good guyz"  who attempt to prevent the attacks that could be caused by the black hat hackers.
The orgs officially hire them to use their technical skills to break into the systems and test their network security and check the vulnerabilities in systems before the black hat attacker detects them and exploit them.

The techniques are same as of the black hat hackers but they dont do any harm they just find the loop holes and vulnerabilities in the systems and prevent them.

Ethical hacking is carried out by these type of hackers.
