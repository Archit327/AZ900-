What is cloud computing?
basically cloud computing is the delivery of computing services oevr the internet. Services including infrastructure which is computing storage and networking,and other services like security and IOT AI MLetc.

If u need a new datacenter than no need to build one on premises rather chose cloud as it provides uh with all the datacenter feature and literaaly more than that of on-prem.


AS we go on SHARE RESPONSIBILITY MODEL

it can be come to highlight that what are tha different categories of work and which comes under whose section.

Youâ€™ll always be responsible for:

- The information and data stored in the cloud
- Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
- The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

The cloud provider is always responsible for:

- The physical datacenter
- The physical network
- The physical hosts

Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:

- Operating systems
- Network controls
- Applications
- Identity and infrastructure


What r the factors affecting cost in azure-->

* resource type
* loaction
* consumption
* maintainance
* netwrok traffic
* subscription type
* azure market place(services by the 3rd party vendord as well as the services of azure)*


**Pricing calculator**

It gives the estimated cost for provisioning the resources in azure.
it is used for info prpose which helps giving the estimated price which will be costing u  to use that respective resources with the respective configuration and location.
try for every type of resource possible and choose the one whih perfectly defines ur requiremnet and is under ur budget.



**Total Cost of Ownership TCO**

Tco helps u to compare the onprem costing and azure based costing.

just define all the infra u require in for ur orgs which can be compute , storage and network and other services and it will show u the TOTAL COST which will estimated .

tco doesnt calculte the power supply ur resources will use or the labour cost . it just adds up the cost for using the services and infra resiurces that u ropting for.


# costmanagement 

* quicly check the cost that azure resources are using rn
* it creates alerts based on resource spend and creates budget that can be used to automate mangmnt of resrces 
* there is feature of COST ANALYSIS that does the work of analysing the cost of the resorces *

* it uses alerts like-
   * budget alert--> which will notify that the budget u decied for the resources is going to exceed 
   * credit alert--> this will notify that the credit u had in azure portal is trying to be finished , it will notified twice at 90% and 100% consumption is reched*
