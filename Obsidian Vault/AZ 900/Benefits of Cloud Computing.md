-  You can gradually move to cloud, called also _**lift and shift**_
- You're able to spend more time on what matters and less time managing the underlying details.

**COST EFFECTIVE**

- Provides **pay-as-you-go** or **consumption-based** pricing model.
    - No upfront infrastructure costs
    - No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure/hardware that you may not use to its fullest
    - The ability to pay for additional resources only when they are needed
    - The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed
- Enables better cost predictions using pricing of individual resources/services.
    - You can analyze future growth using historical data.


**SCALABLE**

- Increase or decrease the resources and services used based on the demand or workload at any given time
- Cloud computing supports both:
    - **Horizontal scaling**
        - Scaling "out"
        - Adding more servers that function together as one unit
    - **Vertical scaling**
        - Scaling "up"
        - Adding resources to increase the power of an existing server
            - e.g.Add more CPUs, or add more memory
- Scaling can be done manually or automatically based on e.g.
    - specific triggers such as CPU utilization


**REALIABLE**
DATA backup , disaster recovery data replication services, FAULT TOLERANT 

with the help of availability set and availabilty zones , the azure makes its services reliable as if there is a diaster and the datacenter get affected by it then the other available set vms will come into play  and do the task.

**AVAILABLE**
cloud services are globally available.
cloud provides its service with highest availablity , as of azure and its SLA azure can provide upto six 9's i.e 99.9999% of availabilty . this means barely seconds of downtime in whole month.

Availability zones and availability sets are features  which can be used to get more availbilty

wiht the help of fault domain and update domains , if there is some updat to be done or may be there is a downtime or failure in any vms then these take up the responsibilty.
