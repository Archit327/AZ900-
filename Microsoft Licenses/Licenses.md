![[Pasted image 20240220220041.png]]


pretty much all the features available in defender for endpoint plan 1 is same as of in defender for business.

requirements-->

![[Pasted image 20240221151753.png]]


So defender fro business doesnt have the feature of deploying server to the endpoint it just provides the client's devices to onboard and secure that too 5 devices per client, thus it also brings one more license which can be added to the this particular defender for business license. that add-on license is nothing but ==defender for business server==.

- also defender for business license can be included in m365 business premium license.
- and if we talk about defender for endpoint we can see below

![[Pasted image 20240221153437.png]]

So basically what can we conclude that defender for endpoint plan 1 and plan 2 are included in m365 E3 and E5 licenses respectively such that plan 1 is enabled with m365 E3 and if u want plan 2 then u must have m365 E5 license. 
### Features of defender for business

### Defender for endpoint Plan 1 & 2

![[Pasted image 20240221152414.png]]


Both the license have almost same functionality of threat & vulnerability management , attack surface reduction , next gen protection , endpoint detection end response , auto investigation and remediation. 


But the usecase they are made or can be used are different such that defender for business is license used by small medium business organizations having employees upto 300.

But for defender for endpoint plan 1 and 2 are used by large organizations, which consist of employees more than 300.

But its not a compulsory for any small org to use the defender for business license it can also take the license of m365E5 its all upto them.

#### Defender for business server
license needed--> 
	M365 business premium

	after purchasing any of those license you can go to microsoft defender portal https://security.microsoft.com
- with this license user can access to defender portal to manage the endpoints 
- recommended to small and medium size business or org (upto 300 employees)
- In order to add on Microsoft Defender for Business servers, you'll need at least one paid license for [Defender for Business](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-business/mdb-overview?view=o365-worldwide) (standalone) or [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business-premium/m365bp-overview?view=o365-worldwide).
- There's a limit of 60 Microsoft Defender for Business servers licenses per subscription to Microsoft 365 Business Premium or Defender for Business.
- If preferred, you could use [Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 or Plan 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers) instead to onboard your servers.
- You need one Microsoft Defender for Business servers license  for each instance of Windows Server or Linux, and you don't assign that license to users or devices.

Defender for server plan 1 & 2

license requirements -->
this defender for server plan 1&2 are subscription based plans so if u have m365 E3 or E5
also if u have M365 Business Premium 

so basically the licenses which provide access to services like azure active directory , which is essential for managing identities and access to azure resources.
so with azure ad integration we can use the particular license to sign in to azure portal , and that will get access to defender for sever plan 1& 2 according to the limitations of the license (for example with m365 e3 u get access to azure portal but u get  feature of server plan1 only)


#### Features of defender for business server and defender for server plan 1 & 2

while both solutions provide security for servers, Microsoft Defender for Business Server is geared towards smaller organizations with simpler needs, while Microsoft Defender for Server Plan 1 is designed for larger enterprises with more complex security requirements and a broader range of threats to mitigate. 
The choice between the two licenses would depend on factors such as the size and complexity of the organization's server infrastructure, as well as its specific security needs and budget considerations.

The Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) is a lightweight agent used to monitor Windows and Linux computers in Microsoft's monitoring and management solutions. It's part of the broader suite of tools for monitoring and managing IT infrastructure and applications. The primary purpose of MMA is to collect performance data, events, and other information from the monitored computers and send it to the monitoring solution for analysis and reporting.

MMA is commonly used in conjunction with System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) and Azure Monitor. It enables administrators to monitor the health, performance, and availability of their IT environments, including servers, applications, and services. MMA can be deployed across a range of environments, including on-premises, in the cloud, and in hybrid configurations, providing flexibility for organizations with diverse IT infrastructures.

Key features of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) include:

1. **Data Collection**: MMA collects performance metrics, event logs, and other data from Windows and Linux computers.

2. **Heartbeat Monitoring**: It sends regular heartbeat signals to the monitoring solution to indicate that the monitored computer is online and functioning.

3. **Alerting and Notification**: MMA can trigger alerts based on predefined thresholds or conditions and send notifications to administrators or other stakeholders.

4. **Integration**: MMA integrates with other Microsoft monitoring and management solutions, allowing organizations to centralize monitoring and management activities.

Overall, the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) plays a critical role in enabling proactive monitoring and management of IT infrastructure, helping organizations to maintain high levels of performance, availability, and reliability.




As of my last update in January 2022, Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) is the successor to the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA), offering several improvements and enhancements over its predecessor. Here's how Azure Monitor Agent is better than the older Microsoft Monitoring Agent:

1. **Unified Agent for Azure**: Azure Monitor Agent is designed to be the single agent for collecting telemetry data from Azure resources, on-premises servers, and virtual machines, as well as from other cloud environments. This unified approach simplifies deployment and management compared to the separate agents required for Azure and non-Azure environments with MMA.

2. **Enhanced Scalability**: Azure Monitor Agent is built to handle large-scale environments more efficiently, offering better scalability and performance compared to MMA. It can handle a higher volume of telemetry data while minimizing resource utilization on monitored systems.

3. **Flexible Configuration**: Azure Monitor Agent provides more flexible configuration options, allowing users to customize which data sources and telemetry types are collected based on their specific monitoring requirements. This flexibility enables organizations to optimize data collection for their unique needs, reducing unnecessary data ingestion and storage costs.

4. **Improved Integration with Azure Services**: Azure Monitor Agent offers tighter integration with Azure services and features, providing enhanced monitoring capabilities for Azure resources such as virtual machines, containers, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It also supports newer features in Azure Monitor, such as Log Analytics workspaces and Application Insights.

5. **Built-in Security Features**: Azure Monitor Agent includes built-in security features to help protect telemetry data during collection and transmission. It supports encrypted communication protocols and authentication mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of monitoring data.

6. **Continuous Updates and Support**: Azure Monitor Agent benefits from ongoing updates and support from Microsoft, ensuring that it remains compatible with the latest Azure services and features. This continuous improvement cycle helps organizations stay current with their monitoring capabilities and security requirements.

Overall, Azure Monitor Agent offers a more streamlined and comprehensive solution for monitoring hybrid and multi-cloud environments compared to the older Microsoft Monitoring Agent. Organizations transitioning to Azure-based monitoring solutions can benefit from the enhanced features, scalability, and integration capabilities provided by Azure Monitor Agent.
